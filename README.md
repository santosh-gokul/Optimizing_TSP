# Optimizing_TSP
Using custom cross-over based GA

I've optimized the tour length of a 194 city TSP problem using heuristic Genetic Algorithm. The initial set of population was constructed using the Christophide's algorithm for finding near-optimal tour. The solution obtained after running the algorithm for 1000 generations was about 2739 away from the minimal tour (9532). The cross-over operator and the mutation strategy used were custom developed for this application.
